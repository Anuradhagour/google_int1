The analysis of the Google Play Store dataset reveals key trends in mobile app development and user behavior. Most successful apps tend to be free, belong to certain popular categories like "Games" and "Tools", and have higher ratings and review counts. Furthermore, user ratings and app size show some correlation with install counts. These findings suggest that optimizing user experience, ensuring quality, and choosing the right category can significantly enhance an appâ€™s performance in the marketplace


Tasks

1. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between revenue and the number of installs for paid apps only. Add a trendline to show the correlation and color-code the points based on app categories.

Apply filters to exclude apps with fewer than 10,000 installs and revenue below $10,000 and android version should be more than 4.0 as well as size should be more than 15M and content rating should be Everyone and app name should not have more than 30 characters including space and special character .this graph should work only between 1 PM IST to 2 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.

3. Plot a time series line chart to show the trend of total installs over time, segmented by app category. Highlight periods of significant growth by shading the areas under the curve where the increase in installs exceeds 20% month-over-month and app name should not starts with x, y ,z and app category should start with letter " E " or " C " or " B " and reviews should be more than 500 as well as this graph should work only between 6 PM IST to 9 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.
